<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Three-day humidity comparison](https://github.com/ariharasudhanm/IoT-based-environmental-monitoring/blob/main/assets/Three_day__humidity_data.png)

Initially DHT11 sensor is connected to Raspberry pi zero to mine the temperature and humidity data inside a closed room environment then data is then continuosly fed to thingspeak cloud using APIs. 

Project Overview:
* Data is fed from raspberry pi to cloud.
* Creating a machine learning model with the time series data to predict the future temperature and humidity of an environment.
* Model deployment in cloud.

For machine learning model initially, we will use neural networks to buid the model as a starting point since it could be highly efficient for time series data.

### Built With

These are the programming languages, libraries, frameworks, cloud services and other tools used in this project.

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/)
* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
As mentioned in the roadmap the first step is preparing the trained model which is under going now. Further steps will be continuosly updated.


### Data Processing
Data visualization of mined data using few samples to get a better insights about the data.
data_visualization.ipynb`.

![Past_humidity_reading](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49080561/148678165-bede04a6-ed49-4275-b0ac-fe3cef2978dc.png)

This image can be found under `Images/Past humidity reading.png`

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Model creation and deployment
For now code for forward propagation for the network is alrready written which can be found under `forward.py`. Soon backpropogation and trained model will be updated.


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
